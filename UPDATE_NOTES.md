# AI Agents Presentation - Latest Update

## 🎉 What's New in This Version

This package contains the latest version of the AI Agents presentation with significant improvements and fixes.

### ✅ Fixed Issues

#### 1. **Thumbnail Display Fixed**
- **Issue:** Slides 8, 9, and 10 (Reflex Agents, Goal & Utility-Based Agents, Learning Agents) were showing gray placeholder areas instead of colorful thumbnails
- **Solution:** Replaced Tailwind CSS gradient classes with inline CSS gradients for better compatibility
- **Result:** All thumbnails now display correctly with proper colors and icons

#### 2. **Enhanced Navigation**
- **Issue:** Limited navigation from title slide with only 6 section links
- **Solution:** Added comprehensive navigation to all 28 individual slides
- **Result:** Users can now jump directly to any specific slide from the title slide

### 🚀 Key Improvements

#### **Complete Slide Navigation**
The title slide now includes direct links to all slides:
- 📚 Foundation slides (5 slides)
- 🤖 Agent Types (5 slides)
- ⚙️ Architecture & Technical (5 slides)
- 🛠️ Frameworks & Tools (4 slides)
- 💼 Applications & Implementation (4 slides)
- 🎯 Best Practices (5 slides)

#### **Visual Enhancements**
